they are stay in /sys/kernel/tracing.
in old place they are stay in /sys/kernel/debug/tracing.


U can see a available_tracers for what you want to trace


u gotta "echo <available_tracers> > current_tracer" for tracing 


when u wanna see a result u gotta "cat trace". this is all done 


NEXT if u wanna use filter a module kernel u gotta "echo <available_filter_functions> > set_ftrace_filter"


to be honest, they are tons of functions for playing around . this is just a basic "ftrace". 


TIP! if u wanna to set empty to /sys/kernel/tracing/current_tracer . u gotta type "echo nop > current_tracer" . and in filter gotta be a "echo > set_ftrace_filter"
